## 🧪 Lab Descriptions

| Lab No. | Title | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **1** | useState & Live Input Update | Set up a new React project using `create-react-app`. Use `useState` to update an `<h1>` dynamically as the user types in an input field. |
| **2** | Props: Parent to Child | Pass data from a parent `App` component to `Header` and `Footer` components using props. Dynamically update and display title, tagline, etc. |
| **3** | Counter App | Create a counter with `useState`. Add increment, decrement, and reset functionality. Prevent values below 0. Support custom step sizes. |
| **4** | To-Do List App | Build a to-do list using functional components and `useState`. Add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Visually differentiate tasks. |
| **5** | Image Gallery with Props | Use component composition. `FigureList` renders multiple `BasicFigure` components. Pass image and caption via props. Allow add/remove with styled UI. |
| **6** | React Form with Validation | Build a form with fields for name, email, and password. Validate inputs, show errors, and toggle password visibility. Prevent invalid submissions. |
| **7** | ProfileCard with Styling | Display a user profile with name, image, and bio using a `ProfileCard`. Use external CSS and inline styling. Add dynamic background and hover effects. |
| **8** | Reminder App with Filters | Manage tasks with due dates and optional descriptions. Filter by status (all/completed/pending). Add/edit/remove reminders dynamically. |
| **9** | React Routing | Implement routing with `react-router-dom`. Create navigation bar with links to Home, About, and Contact. Highlight active route. |
| **10** | Class Component + API | Use class component and lifecycle methods. Fetch data with `componentDidMount`. Update and filter with `componentDidUpdate`. Handle errors and show structured data. |
